You should use the preprocessor macro __LINE__ and __FILE__. They are predefined macros and part of the C/C++ standard. During preprocessing, they are replaced respectively by a constant string holding an integer representing the current line number and by the current file name.

Others preprocessor variables :

__func__ : function name (this is part of C99, not all C++ compilers support it)
__DATE__ : a string of form "Mmm dd yyyy"
__TIME__ : a string of form "hh:mm:ss"
